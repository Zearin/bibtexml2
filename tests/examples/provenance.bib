  abstract  = {The first Provenance Challenge was set up in order to
          provide a forum for the community to understand the
          capabilities of different provenance systems and the
          expressiveness of their provenance representations. To this
          end, a functional magnetic resonance imaging workflow was
          defined, which participants had to either simulate or run
          in order to produce some provenance representation, from
          which a set of identified queries had to be implemented and
          executed. Sixteen teams responded to the challenge, and
          submitted their inputs. In this paper, we present the
          challenge workflow and queries, and summarize the
          participants' contributions.},
